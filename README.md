# ShopScout (Android) — RapidAPI + Retrofit + OkHttp

## Why this API?
I chose **Real-Time Product Search** on **RapidAPI** because:
- It has a **free BASIC plan** with **no credit card required** (100 requests/month), so assessors can run the app immediately.  
- The dataset (product titles, images, links) is **instantly useful** for a mobile experience: quick searches while shopping or price-checking.  
- It’s available through RapidAPI, which standardizes auth headers and has copy-pasteable code snippets.
